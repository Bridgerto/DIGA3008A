        <h2>
          Section 1: How we code matters - introducing Critical Code Literacies
          by Hanli Geyser
        </h2>
        <p>
          For this week’s blog, I will be speaking about Hanli’s Devconf Talk,
          where she challenges the myth that code is neutral or purely
          technical. She shows that people often talk about programming and
          treat it like it’s just math or logic (something neutral and
          objective). But coding is in fact actually a form of communication
          that is part of meaning-making. Just like how words carry meaning,
          emotion, and intention, so does the code that we write. When we write
          code, we’re not just solving problems, we are making choices. Every
          tiny decision, like what features to include, what data to ask for,
          how users interact with the site all reflects the way we have been
          taught to think. That way of thinking has a name: it’s called a
          paradigm, and it’s shaped by our beliefs, our education, and the
          systems we live in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Often, we don’t even realize that we’ve been taught to think in ways
          that come from colonial systems (systems that made one way of knowing
          seem like the only “correct” or “valid” way). In the talk Hanli gives
          the example of with 2+2=, in one situation, it’s true. But change the
          context, and suddenly 4 squares arranged together might look like 5.
          Showing that how we answer questions depends on what we know, and what
          we know depends on how we’ve been taught to think. The same goes for
          how we write code: we make assumptions based on what we think is
          “normal” or “universal,” but those assumptions might exclude people
          with different experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          This lecture pushed me to start asking new questions when I code
          Because really, the goal it’s not just about being a good programmer.
          It’s about being a responsible one. Instead of just focusing on
          writing code that works, I need to focus on writing code that cares —
          code that includes more people, respects differences, and challenges
          those “default” settings that are rooted in colonial ways of thinking.
          So when I code my website, I need to look at: <br />
          Who is it for? <br />
          Who might be left out? <br />
          What ideas or biases am I bringing with me without even realizing?<br />
        </p>

        <p>
          And when I actually sit down and reflect, I see there are a lot of
          things I can do better. One of the first things is making sure my
          website works for people with disabilities, not just sighted, hearing,
          or fully able-bodied users. That means using semantic HTML so screen
          readers can properly read the content. It means checking that my color
          contrast is strong enough for people with low vision or color
          blindness. I also need to make sure that my site is navigable for
          people who can’t use a keyboard or mouse in the “normal” way. And of
          course, making sure it scales to any screen size because not everyone
          has a PC or laptop; many rely on phones or shared devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          But even with all these accessibility fixes, there’s still the bigger
          issue of digital access itself. What about people who don’t have
          internet access at all? Or those who aren’t digitally literate? That’s
          something no amount of responsive design can fix, it reminds me that
          tech solutions can’t be separated from real-world inequality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another thing I’ve had to be honest about is how my project imposes a
          specific way of knowing. I’ve drawn a lot of inspiration from fashion
          and digital art websites, but most of those come from the global
          North. So, even without realizing, I’m importing a singular, Western
          aesthetic and knowledge system. I need to be more conscious of that.
          I’ll work on making my fonts, layouts, and visual metaphors more
          culturally sensitive, more globally accessible. So yep, this lecture
          helped me realize that code is not neutral. It’s communication. And
          the way I code tells a story, I just have to make sure it’s one that
          includes, not excludes.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Section 2: Reflection on the Reading - Algorithmic Colonization of
          Africa: Abeba Birhane
        </h2>
        <p>
          Abeba Birhane’s piece opened my eyes to how technology, especially
          systems like AI and algorithms, is not just about cool innovations —
          it’s deeply tied to power, control, and sometimes harm. Birhane talks
          about something called algorithmic colonization, which is basically
          when powerful tech companies from the West bring their tools and
          systems into African countries and say they are “helping”, but what
          they’re really doing is imposing their values and systems, just like
          colonial powers did in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
          One example that really stuck with me was how companies use African
          countries to test out surveillance technology, or how they build
          facial recognition systems that can’t even recognize Black faces
          properly. Google's photo-tagging AI once labeled African-American
          faces as “gorillas” due to biased training data. It’s scary because
          these systems are being exported to countries that didn’t build them
          and don’t get a say in how they work. It’s like being forced to use a
          tool that wasn’t made for you and worse, one that could actually harm
          you.
        </p>

        <p>
          The author explains that a lot of these technologies are being built
          using data from African people, but those same people don’t get to
          decide what happens with their data. It’s like someone coming into
          your house, taking your stuff, and then selling it back to you while
          pretending they are doing you a favor. But Birhane’s piece is not just
          doom and gloom. She talks about the importance of building systems
          that are grounded in community values, that respect context and
          culture. She calls for African voices to lead in tech conversations,
          not just be “included,” but actually be the ones shaping what ethical
          and fair technology looks like.

        <h2>Section 3: My JavaScript Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I want my navigation system to be javascript based, to make it modular
          and less static. <br />
          My homepage will have a logo that expands and shrinks for dynamism.<br />
          I will have a return to top to bottom to make it hassle free for my
          users. <br />
          Then my website will be modular with I add a drop down menu from small
          screen sizes. <br />
