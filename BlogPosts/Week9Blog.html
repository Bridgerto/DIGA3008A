        <h2>Digital Divide Widens: Maria Tataki & Dimitris Glynos</h2>
        <p>
          In the article, Digital Divide Widens, Tataki and Glynos address the
          effects of the Covid-19 pandemic by emphasizing how this period
          magnified existing digital inequalities together with the layers that
          come with this digital divide. The core argument that is focused on in
          the article is realising that digital access should no longer be a
          luxury but really a fundamental right exhausted to everyone. The
          argument has become important because the pandemic has highlighted the
          cost of digital exclusion. The article reveals that people who come
          from lower-income households usually suffer the most when it comes to
          receiving accessibility.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I think a further analysis into the situation is realising that
          accessibility is only the tip of the iceberg, assuming that ‘access
          alone is enough’ - is a problem! Having a device or an internet
          connection does not mean one can meaningfully participate in digital
          life, as Nanjira Sambuli said we need to “[dissect] the analog and the
          digital aspects of political, social, cultural, economic dimensions in
          society today… to ensure that we do not widen inequalities through
          digital technologies” (Sambuli 2019). In other words, there are more
          factors that play into the existence of the digital divide. The
          systemic structures need to interrogate whether the people receiving
          digital access also have digital literacy (Can users critically engage
          with content, avoid misinformation, or protect their privacy?) or even
          cultural relevance (Is the content accessible in one’s language or
          aligned with their local realities?). Over and above this, is also
          interrogating the metrics used, it is acknowledged that “830 million
          [students] do not have access to computers” (Tataki and Glynos 2020)
          but are we focusing too much on infrastructure, focusing more on
          people having devices, the correct bandwidth and not enough on
          long-term strategies like curriculum reform, digital training, and
          sustainable access.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the article briefly acknowledges how girls and students in
          Sub-Saharan Africa are more disadvantaged, it could go further in
          using an intersectional lens. There are even more different aspects of
          identity (gender, race, age, disability, geographic location, or
          refugee status) that come into play to heighten the digital divide.
          For instance, a girl living in a rural area of Kenya faces gender
          bias, she could lack privacy at home to study online, or may face more
          chores during lockdowns. But also, she faces the infrastructural
          neglect and potentially linguistic barriers when accessing content
          online. A further step I took was looking into Kositany-Buckner’s
          article, Digital inclusion, his work helped deepen the understanding
          of how these overlapping disadvantages function digitally. But to go
          back to the article, it speaks of the Egyptian government handing out
          free SIM cards to students and free data plans, but does not question
          the sustainability of these measures. Emergency responses may bridge
          the gap momentarily, but what happens once these schemes end? A
          critical engagement here would raise concerns about whether these
          reactive interventions are setting up long-term infrastructure, or if
          they simply reinforce a cycle of dependence without structural reform.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another aspect of the article is drawing attention to workers who
          cannot afford to work from home, but more critique is needed on how
          the digital divide is linked to poor paid working conditions. Many
          essential workers—such as domestic workers, security guards, and
          delivery drivers—are not only physically present during the pandemic
          but are often excluded from digital services like banking apps, online
          health consultations, or job listings that are migrating online. Which
          reinforces the idea that the digital divide is also tied to a class
          divide, we have what is termed the “digital underclass” that is
          permanently sidelined from full participation in the digital economy.
        </p>

        <p>
          So all in all, access should not just be about consumption; it should
          include the ability to contribute to and shape the digital world. The
          article focuses on education and telework, but leaves out how digital
          divides affect civic participation, cultural production, and activism.
          Marginalized communities need platforms where they can express,
          document, and organise. The key message is emphasising that alot more
          can be done, a lot more should be done to bridge the digital divide.
