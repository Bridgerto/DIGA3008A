          Working through the slides for Interaction Design for the web, define
          and discuss your user alignment, and map out your site's content,
          experience, and interface elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reflect on how the exercise above relates to what you know about your
          structure and URL scheme and how it relates to semantic markup.
        </p>

        <p>Step 1: Define Your User Alignment</p>
        <p>
          For me, defining my user alignment begins with understanding the goal
          of my site. I want a website that is chic, elegant and encompasses a
          sophisticated experience. I want it to look neat and put together so
          that my user will be served first-class treatment. I want my target
          audience to be anyone who is interested in a niche that marries
          animation with fashion elements. This is because I take animation and
          I plan to show the skills Iâ€™ve acquired through the medium of fashion.
          I want my target audience to visit my site with the intent of
          exploring an innovation that takes two art forms that have been
          blended into a singular form. My biggest priority is to make my site
          easily accessible and easy to navigate. For anyone to receive
          first-class treatment, everything has to be made available at their
          disposal. I want my target audience to understand the site structure,
          view key information and constantly understand where they are. I also
          want a website that is versatile and is able to be accessed from
          various devices. When users go on my site for a source of inspiration
          as this will be a platform with high-quality visuals that display my
          portfolio work. More than anything, I want it to be a fun experience
          of exploring and viewing my work that consists of an industry-specific
          portfolio.
