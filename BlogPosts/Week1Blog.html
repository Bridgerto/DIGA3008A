    My Experience with setting up GitHub was paradoxically both simple and complicated. 
    When the steps of setting it up in class were explained, it seemed straightforward. 
    But sitting alone and attempting to do it was not a linear process. The first hurdle was 
    realising that I misunderstood Visual Studios as Visual Studio Code. 
    So you could imagine the frustration of staring at slides with VSCode having a 
    blue interface while I had Visual Studios open and I kept seeing a purple interface. 
    Eventually, I figured it out and downloaded VSCode.
