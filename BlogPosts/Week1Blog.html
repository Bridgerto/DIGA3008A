        <h2>SECTION 1: Github Set-up</h2>
        <p>
          SETTING UP My Experience with setting up GitHub was paradoxically both
          simple and complicated. When the steps of setting it up in class were
          explained, it seemed straightforward. But sitting alone and attempting
          to do it was not a linear process. The first hurdle was realising that
          I misunderstood Visual Studios as Visual Studio Code. So you could
          imagine the frustration of staring at slides with VSCode having a blue
          interface while I had Visual Studios open and I kept seeing a purple
          interface. Eventually, I figured it out and downloaded VSCode.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, the next hiccup was misunderstanding one of the slides.
          After opening a new file in VSCode, and typing “index.html”. I was
          meant to type the exclamation mark (!), then click the tab button on
          the keyboard. But the slide did not explain it this way, it had
          written type !(tab). I was stuck on the step for a good day, but I
          reached out to my peers and got it sorted. From this point onwards,
          everything was smooth sailing. Overall, I would rate the experience a
          7/10.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION 2: The World-Wide Web (1994) by Tim Berners-Lee et al.</h2>
        <p>
          I chose an article by Tim Berners-Lee published in 1994, titled The
          World-Wide Web. This written piece introduces the origin of the WWW
          or, as the article refers to it, W3 which was initially created at
          CERN to help researchers manage and circulate information more
          efficiently. What stood out to me was how something so embedded in our
          everyday lives came from such a practical need: making knowledge more
          accessible within a specialized academic community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Berners-Lee dives deep into the technical foundation of the web,
          detailing core elements like HTML, HTTP, TCP/IP, URIs, and SGML
          parsers. At first, I was overwhelmed by the amount of new terminology
          and protocols being introduced. Reading about these terms wasn’t the
          real challenge — it was understanding how they worked together as a
          system. It felt like being thrown into algebra without learning basic
          arithmetic. Like you know in Maths, you are first taught that 2 + 2 =
          4 this foundation of addition later helps one understand why 4/2 = 2.
          I kept wishing there was a beginner-friendly structure that could map
          out the relationships between these parts: for example, how HTML
          structures the content, HTTP helps transmit it, and URIs tell you
          where to find it.
        </p>

        <p>
          After stepping away and revisiting the article later, something
          shifted. I started connecting the dots, recognizing that the web isn’t
          a single tool, but a network of interdependent components. TCP/IP
          ensures devices can talk to each other, HTTP carries the requests and
          responses, and URIs act like coordinates to locate documents across
          the web. Even the GET, POST, and PUT methods began to make more sense
          as mechanisms for interacting with servers. Revisiting the article
          helped me realize that understanding the web isn’t about memorizing
          definitions. It’s about grasping how everything works together. And
          once I started seeing those connections, the reading stopped feeling
          so foreign and started feeling foundational.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION 3: The History of Flash by Jay Hoffman</h2>
        <p>
          READING 2 FLASH I read an article, Flash And Its History On The Web,
          which unpacks the history behind FuturespLASH (FLASH) along with its
          evolution. Initially, FLASH was a FutureSplash Animator that was
          developed by FutureWave Software in the mid-1990s to be used as an
          animation tool for pen computing devices. In late 1996, Macromedia
          bought FutureSplash and rebranded it as FLASH. Software's prevalence
          picked up when it introduced the feature to stream compressed video
          content directly within web browsers. This feature would become the
          foundational blocks of how YouTube came to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          TIMELINES Next I read a website that breaks down that timeline of the
          history ofthe web between 2002 and 2017. This timeline was interesting
          because it revealed how tech companies shape the industry not just
          through innovation but through carefully timed decisions that reshape
          the competitive landscape. iPhone strategically designed mobile
          devices that were released to not need the FLASH function. This forced
          web developers to transition to HTML5, which was more open and
          efficient but also happened to weaken Adobe's grip on web content.
        </p>

        <h2>SECTION 4: Course Goals</h2>
        <p>
          My goal in this course is to learn with intention. I really want to
          begin exploring the fun of web creation.
