        <p>
          SECTION 1: SETTING UP My Experience with setting up GitHub was
          paradoxically both simple and complicated. When the steps of setting
          it up in class were explained, it seemed straightforward. But sitting
          alone and attempting to do it was not a linear process. The first
          hurdle was realising that I misunderstood Visual Studios as Visual
          Studio Code. So you could imagine the frustration of staring at slides
          with VSCode having a blue interface while I had Visual Studios open
          and I kept seeing a purple interface. Eventually, I figured it out and
          downloaded VSCode.
        </p>

        <p>
          From there, the next hiccup was misunderstanding one of the slides.
          After opening a new file in VSCode, and typing “index.html”. I was
          meant to type the exclamation mark (!), then click the tab button on
          the keyboard. But the slide did not explain it this way, it had
          written type !(tab). I was stuck on the step for a good day, but I
          reached out to my peers and got it sorted. From this point onwards,
          everything was smooth sailing. Overall, I would rate the experience a
          7/10.
        </p>

        <p>
          SECTION 2: READING 1 I chose an article by Tim Bernes-Lee published in
          1994, titled The World Wide Web. This phenomenal written piece
          introduces the origin of the WWW or as the article says, W3, to have
          been created at CERN to solve the problem of information circulation
          amongst researchers. Here Bernes-Lee goes into details about the
          structures that were used to create W3: from HTML, HTTP, TCP, IP, URIs
          to SGML parsers.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think for me, what became overwhelming was the depth of the
          technical details introduced in the paper, along with a library of
          foundational concepts. Reading about these terms and details was not
          the main problem, the challenge was making the mental connection of
          how each term works with one another. Like you know in Maths, you are
          first taught that 2 + 2 = 4 this foundation of addition later helps
          one understand why 4/2 = 2.
        </p>

        <p>
          I wish there was a similar system offered when learning of web
          terminology, a structure that helps one see the connection of the
          terms about Internet protocols, to URIs vs URLs. Or even the GET, PUT
          or POST methods mentioned in the paper.
        </p>

        <p>
          SECTION 3: READING 2 FLASH I read an article, Flash And Its History On
          The Web, which unpacks the history behind FuturespLASH (FLASH) along
          with its evolution. Initially, FLASH was a FutureSplash Animator that
          was developed by FutureWave Software in the mid-1990s to be used as an
          animation tool for pen computing devices. In late 1996, Macromedia
          bought FutureSplash and rebranded it as FLASH. Software s prevalence
          picked up when it introduced the feature to stream compressed video
          content directly within web browsers. This feature would become the
          foundational blocks of how YouTube came to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          TIMELINES Next I read a website that breaks down that timeline of the
          history ofthe web between 2002 and 2017. This timeline was interesting
          because it revealed how tech companies shape the industry not just
          through innovation but through carefully timed decisions that reshape
          the competitive landscape. iPhone strategically designed mobile
          devices that were released to not need the FLASH function. This forced
          web developers to transition to HTML5, which was more open and
          efficient but also happened to weaken Adobe s grip on web content.
        </p>

        <p>
          SECTION 4: COURSE GOALS My goal in this course is to learn with
          intention. I really want to begin exploring the fun of web creation.
