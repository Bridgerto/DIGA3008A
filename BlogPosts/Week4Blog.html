          Suggestions: Post your work for the design section of your website,
          which you will submit next week. Work through the IxD Process and
          begin noting your thoughts. You will continue adding to this as you
          progress. Reflect on how your original wireframes hold up in line with
          this process.
        </p>
        <b>Goal alignment</b>
        <p>
          As explained in the previous blog, my goal is to create a website that
          caters first-class treatment to users that visit it. This will be
          achieved through an accessible, cohesive and visually refined website
          that encapsulates sophistication and elegance. This choice is largely
          influenced by my interest in haute couture fashion culture which is
          deeply inspiring my approach to designing this website. My website
          should feel warm and welcoming with an interesting design to it that
          embodies a sophisticated and high fashion-tone to it. This will be
          reflected in every webpage having a carefully curated colour palette,
          intentional font style and appealing visuals to enhance the redefined
          aesthetic. Also, there is a well-structured UI that ensures seamless
          navigation - a huge part of first-class experience is ensuring that
          users don’t have to hustle for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I will incorporate a strong information hierarchy and a
          polished layout which enhances readability, making content inviting
          and effortless to consume which will make my users feel called to
          interact with my site. The reason behind this precision in my IxD
          process is because my target audience is companies in the animation
          and Interactive Media industry, as well as artists seeking
          inspiration. I don’t want my website to be ordinary, it should be an
          experience that rejuvenates creativity and sparks inspiration. This
          vision should be maintained all while interacting with subtle class
          and elegance to it. Over and above this, my platform should be
          accessible, so a part of my goal is ensuring that my website can work
          on different devices, so that’s ensuring that my specifications are
          diverse and adoptable.
        </p>
        <b>Your Content</b>
        <p>
          The content of my website will include a homepage, blogs posts,
          essays, portfolio work and to show my personality, a profile will be
          included along with links to webpages where information about me will
          be displayed (Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn etc). I also will have a
          section dedicated to my design process, this will show that I have the
          skillset to plan, implement and execute. I think the most important
          aspects in my content is maintaining consistency and simplicity. This
          decision is also tied to the objective of ensuring that everyone with
          basic knowledge can navigate and operate the function on my site. It
          shouldn’t feel like a person in tech is the only person who can
          explore it. I don't want my users to be overwhelmed by this
          experience, everything should be simple with a professional tone to
          it. What is important and matters most to me is ensuring that my
          website is up to standard and has an artistic flair to it.
        </p>
        <b>Information Structure - Content Mapping </b>
        <!--Insert mindmap image-->
        <p>
          Consistent information that has to be on every webpage is the
          navigation bar and footer. I think another aspect is ensuring that
          every page vividly outlines the page title so that my user is aware of
          their location within my website. The interface elements I will be
          using consist of: buttons, search field, icons, text field modal
          windows and images.
        </p>
        <b>Design - Style Guide & Wireframes </b>
        <p>
          I want my website to look and feel elegant, classy, chic and
          sophisticated. This is obviously related to the haute couture culture
          that I want my website to embody. I want the Didot font for my
          headings and the Avenir font for my body texts. These fonts also have
          good readability and legibility. I want my colour palette to consist
          of muted and neutral tones, these sell an atmosphere of class and
          elegance. They also have a modern feel to them. Most shapes on my
          website will be circular or curved to give off that feminine energy.
        </p>

        <b
          >Reflect on your work for Website 1. Where have you struggled? What
          are you proud of? What do you want to change going forward?
        </b>
        <p>
          My website 1 is fairly okay, I think my area of improvement is
          definitely management. I think I’m pretty good at brainstorming the
          look and feel of my website, however to reach the next level, I have
          to implement these visions I have. So
