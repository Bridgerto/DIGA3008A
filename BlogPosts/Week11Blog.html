        <p>
          In her article Making a Feminist Internet in Africa: Why the Internet
          Needs African Feminists and Feminisms, Sheena Magenya provides a
          powerful account of how African feminist activists have come together
          to reimagine and rework the internet as a space of inclusion, justice,
          and radical presence. The piece centers around the 2019 Making a
          Feminist Internet in Africa (MFIAfrica) gathering, hosted by the
          Association for Progressive Communications Women’s Rights Programme
          (APC WRP), which brought together over 40 African feminist thinkers,
          artists, and digital activists. Against the impact of the COVID-19
          pandemic and its exposure of digital inequalities, Magenya emphasizes
          that feminist internet-making is not merely a theoretical or symbolic
          pursuit. It is a critical response to systemic and overlapping forms
          of marginalization within digital space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The article begins with the context of MFIAfrica, situating it within
          a lineage of global feminist internet-making efforts dating back to
          2014. While previous gatherings occurred in South America, Eastern
          Europe, and Asia, this was the first of its kind held specifically for
          and by African feminists. Magenya argues that such a space is vital
          because African voices remain underrepresented or misrepresented
          online, and the design, governance, and usage of the internet still
          mirror colonial, capitalist, and patriarchal structures. In this way,
          her methodology, which is bringing together diverse African feminist
          voices in one room, is not just participatory but deeply reflective,
          producing a kind of situated feminist knowledge that is collective,
          intersectional, and grounded in lived experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          A central theme in Magenya’s article is the entanglement between
          digital inequalities and broader social injustices. She asserts that
          the internet, much like the offline world, has become a site of
          gender-based violence, surveillance, and erasure. In African contexts,
          these dynamics are exacerbated by poor access to technology,
          underdeveloped digital infrastructure, and laws that do not yet
          recognize online abuse as real violence. This aligns closely with
          Nanjira Sambuli’s argument in What is Digital Equality?, where she
          defines digital inequality as a modern civil rights issue, insisting
          that equitable participation in digital spaces is essential for full
          democratic engagement. Sambuli notes that access is not just about
          connectivity but about meaningful use—having the resources, knowledge,
          and cultural safety to navigate and shape digital space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magenya pushes back against the dominant narrative that sees Africa
          solely as a beneficiary of Western technology. She critiques the
          repeated framing of African technological innovation as reactive,
          shaped only by crisis or scarcity (such as responses to famine,
          disease, or conflict), rather than imaginative or playful. This
          dominant “single story,” as she invokes from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,
          erases African creativity, particularly that of women, queer people,
          and disabled individuals. In a world where mainstream media narratives
          are still largely produced by Western outlets, African feminists’
          presence online becomes an act of defiance, a way to rewrite stories,
          assert visibility, and build new futures.
        </p>
        <p>
          This notion of reclaiming narrative and access is echoed in the work
          of Cheptoo Kositany-Buckner, who emphasizes the importance of
          community-centered internet access. She argues that access should be
          treated as a public good, where communities not only consume content
          but are equipped to create and govern their own networks. Similarly,
          in the article Digital Divide Widens by Maria Tataki and Dimitris
          Glynos, the authors show how the COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the
          severe disparities in internet access, particularly in the Global
          South. With work, education, and healthcare increasingly moving
          online, those without reliable access are excluded from essential
          services and democratic participation.
        </p>
        <p>
          What distinguishes Magenya’s article, however, is its hopeful,
          grounded tone. Rather than being purely diagnostic, it is
          aspirational, envisioning what a feminist internet could look like.
          This internet is not only safe and inclusive but also vibrant, joyful,
          and sensual. She calls for a space with “more glitter and ochre,” full
          of body-positive content, queer African love stories, makeup tutorials
          for gay boys, and fashion for fat Black women. This framing of joy and
          play as resistance is particularly powerful. In a digital ecosystem
          often characterized by violence and toxicity, imagining pleasure as a
          feminist practice becomes radical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, Magenya does not romanticize the road ahead. She acknowledges
          that structural inequalities remain deeply entrenched, and that more
          gatherings, more solidarity, and more action are needed. Her
          conclusion—that the feminist internet is no longer just desirable but
          crucial—resonates with the urgent calls made by Sambuli and others.
          The pandemic has shown us that digital inclusion is a lifeline, not a
          luxury. Without intentional efforts to build feminist,
          African-centered digital spaces, the internet risks becoming a place
          of deepening inequality, not liberation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reflecting critically, one could argue that while the MFIAfrica
          gathering was a powerful intervention, such in-person events may
          struggle to effect change at scale without accompanying structural
          policy shifts. There remains a gap between grassroots feminist digital
          activism and national/international digital policy-making, which is
          still largely shaped by governments and corporate interests. Bridging
          this gap would require not just activism, but also advocacy,
          coalition-building with regulators, and involvement in tech design and
          governance processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, the significance of Magenya’s work lies in its
          insistence that African feminists belong at the center of digital
          futures. She frames storytelling, pleasure, and visibility not as
          extras, but as foundations for justice. As the internet continues to
          shape how we live, love, and resist, making it feminist—making it
          African—is not just a dream. It is a political necessity.
