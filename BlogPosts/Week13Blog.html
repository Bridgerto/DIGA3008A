        <h2>What does an ethical internet look like to you?</h2>
        <p>
          The blog for today concerns a reading by Shani Ogrady. Her work speaks
          on an occurrence at Windsor Great Park, where Roger Silverstone spoke
          about his idea. Roger Silverstone was a theorist in Communication and
          Media, he spent a lot of time thinking about how we use the internet
          and media, like television and computers, to talk to each other and
          understand the world. One day, in a big, quiet park called Windsor
          Great Park, he gave a talk to a group of people. He said something
          very important: the internet isn't just a fun or useful plac, it's
          also a moral space. That means it's a place where we make choices
          about what's right and wrong. Shani Ogrady tells us about that day and
          about Silverstone's big idea. She explains that when we go online,
          like when we watch videos, send messages, or share pictures, we are
          not just pressing buttons. We are connecting with other people, and
          those people matter. Just like how we learn to be kind, take turns,
          and say sorry in real life, we need to learn how to do those things on
          the internet too.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of Silverstone's most important thoughts was about a concept
          called “proper distance.” This means finding a good balance. We
          shouldn't be so far away that we don't care about others, but we also
          shouldn't be so close that we forget to respect their space. The
          internet makes it easy to see what's happening far away, but that
          doesn't mean we always understand or help in the right way. The author
          says we have to be careful and thoughtful when we use the internet.
          It's easy to hurt people with our words or ignore voices that matter.
          That's why she thinks we all need to learn how to be kind and
          responsible digital citizens.This idea connects with how we behave
          online. When we code, post, or share, we're not just pushing buttons.
          We're shaping people's experiences. Just like on a playground, we need
          to ask: “Am I being fair? Am I including others? Am I listening before
          I speak?” That's part of being a good digital citizen. It's about
          remembering that behind every screen is a real person with feelings,
          context, and identity.
        </p>

        <p>
          But here's where things get deeper: Not everyone even has the same
          access to this moral space. And that's where digital inequality and
          digital decoloniality come in. When we talk about the internet as a
          space of connection, we also have to face the truth that many people
          are excluded from it, not just in terms of not having Wi-Fi, but in
          whose voices are heard, whose cultures are represented, and whose
          knowledge is taken seriously. Some communities don't have the tools,
          resources, or even the digital literacy to participate fully. Others
          are represented in ways that are biased, unfair, or stereotyped.
          Silverstone's idea reminds us that our responsibility online isn't
          just personal, it's also structural. We need to help build a more
          ethical internet where more people can participate meaningfully. That
          means pushing back against the “default” digital culture shaped by
          Western, corporate, often white and male perspectives. It means coding
          with care, designing websites that are accessible and culturally
          inclusive, and amplifying voices that have been historically silenced.
        </p>
        <p>
          So digital decoloniality, to me, is also about proper distance,
          knowing when to speak, when to listen, and how to create space for
          others without overpowering or misrepresenting. It's about building an
          internet where connection doesn't just happen, but happens right.
          Where care, fairness, and equity guide not only how we act, but how we
          build the tools others use to act too.
