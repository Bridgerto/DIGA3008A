              From First Push to Flash: A Journey Through the Web's Past and My
              Digital Future.
            </h1>
            <p>
              This blog traces my personal and creative journey into web
              development, beginning with the hands-on experience of setting up
              Git for my first website. From there, I reflect on The World-Wide
              Web (1994) by Tim Berners-Lee et al., exploring how the early
              ideals of openness, decentralization, and connectivity continue to
              shape our digital lives. Finally, I dive into Jay Hoffman's
              article on the history of Flash, examining how it transformed the
              web into a space of rich visual expression. Then explore what its
              rise and fall reveals about the evolution of online creativity.

              Sketching the Web: Tracing Moulthrop’s Hypertext Theory to My
              Website’s Structure, Design, and Inspiration.
            </h1>
            <p>
              This blog captures the early stages of my website creation
              journey, starting with a reflection on Stuart Moulthrop’s You Say
              You Want a Revolution?, which explores hypertext and its impact on
              media, authorship, and user interaction. I then walk through my
              design process, from organizing my folder structure and developing
              a clear, scalable URL scheme to sketching my first wireframes for
              layout and navigation. The final section highlights websites that
              inspire my visual and interactive approach, helping me think more
              critically about design aesthetics, user experience,
              accessibility, and the broader possibilities of storytelling on
              the web.

            </h1>
            <p>
              In this blog, I reflect on my interaction design process by
              defining my user alignment and mapping out my website's content,
              user experience, and interface elements. Drawing from the course
              slides, I explore how these design choices support accessibility,
              clarity, and user goals. I also connect this planning exercise to
              my site's structure and URL scheme, highlighting the importance of
              semantic HTML in organizing content meaningfully for both users
              and search engines. Finally, I offer a brief update on my
              development progress for the week, noting key improvements and
              next steps in the design and coding phases.

              In this blog, I share my progress on the design section of my
              website in preparation for next week's submission. I begin
              engaging with the Interaction Design (IxD) process, noting initial
              thoughts and observations that will evolve over time. I reflect on
              how my original wireframes compare to my current design direction,
              evaluating what's holding up and what needs refinement.
              Additionally, I review my experience working on Website 1,
              acknowledging the challenges I've faced, what I'm proud of
              achieving so far, and what I aim to improve going forward in both
              design and development.

            <h1>NetFlorist, Takealot, Showmax: Weighing UX/UI for Analysis</h1>
            <p>
              In this blog, I explore potential websites for my upcoming UX and
              UI analysis essay. I focus on three South African platforms:
              NetFlorist, Takealot, and Showmax. For each, I assess the pros and
              cons in terms of user experience and interface design. I examine
              factors such as layout clarity, ease of navigation, visual
              consistency, and overall usability. This comparison helps me
              narrow down the most suitable site for a critical analysis, based
              on both design strengths and areas that could be improved.

              Sambuli, and Kositany-Buckner to explore the persistent and
              evolving nature of the digital divide. I examine how structural

              meaning of digital equality, and highlight the need for inclusive
              digital design grounded in social justice principles.

              In Blog 10, I closely analyse Spyros Kasapis's article on why
              internet access should be a fundamental right, especially in times
              of crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. I explore how his ethical
              arguments expose digital inequality, while also critiquing the
              article's gaps, such as its lack of solutions and attention to
              digital literacy—within the wider debate on digital justice.

              Feminist Eyes
            </h1>
            <p>
              In Blog 11, I explore Sheena Magenya's vision of a feminist
              internet rooted in African experiences, joy, and resistance.
              Through the lens of the MFIAfrica gathering, I analyze how digital
              inequalities intersect with gender, race, and colonial histories.
              Drawing connections to thinkers like Sambuli and Kositany-Buckner,
              I argue that digital decoloniality requires more than access, it
              demands inclusive storytelling, radical imagination, and
              structural change to make digital spaces truly liberating.

            <p>
              In Blog 12, I reflect on how coding is not neutral but a powerful
              form of communication shaped by our beliefs and systems. Inspired
              by Hanli Geyser and Abeba Birhane, I examine my own coding
              practice, from improving accessibility and cultural sensitivity to
              integrating modular JavaScript for better UX. I explore how
              algorithmic colonization impacts Africa and why building
              inclusive, ethical tech means centering local voices and
              decolonizing our digital assumptions.

            <p>
              In Blog 13, I explore what an ethical internet means to me,
              inspired by Roger Silverstone's concept of “proper distance” and
              Shani OGrady's reflections. I argue that the internet is a moral
              space where our choices, whether coding, posting, or designing,
              carry ethical weight. True digital ethics means creating
              inclusive, caring, and decolonial spaces where all voices matter,
              digital inequalities are challenged, and connection is guided by
              fairness, respect, and responsibility.

              In Blog 14, I reflect on how justice and ethics shape my creative
              and coding practices. Drawing on Values at Play by Flanagan, Howe,

              commit to creating with care, staying mindful of impact, and
              ensuring that my work reflects empathy, fairness, and
