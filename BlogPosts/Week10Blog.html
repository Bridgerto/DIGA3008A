        <h2>
          A Close Reading of Spyros Kasapis's “Internet Access is a Fundamental
          Right”
        </h2>

        <p>
          In his article “Internet Access is a Fundamental Right—Especially
          Amidst a Pandemic” (2020), Spyros Kasapis argues that internet access
          is no longer just a nice-to-have, it's something everyone should have
          as a basic right. He compares it to other essential needs like food,
          education, and healthcare. Writing during the COVID-19 pandemic,
          Kasapis shows how important the internet became for daily life, from
          working and learning at home to staying connected and informed. This
          essay takes a closer look at what Kasapis is saying, how he supports
          his ideas, and how his argument fits into wider discussions about
          digital inequality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right from the beginning, Kasapis is clear about what he wants readers
          to think about. He wants governments and the public to take internet
          access seriously, as something everyone deserves. He builds his case
          by referring to ideas about human dignity and happiness, even quoting
          Salvador Allende to show that people can't truly live full lives
          without access to things that help them participate in society. The
          pandemic, he explains, proved just how crucial the internet has
          become. It was the only way many people could attend school, go to
          work, talk to loved ones, or even see a doctor. For people without
          internet access, the lockdown was not just isolating, it cut them off
          from society completely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead of using research data or statistics, Kasapis supports his
          argument with ethical reasoning and examples from the legal world. He
          mentions a 2020 court ruling in India that called internet access a
          constitutional right, and points out that international bodies like
          the United Nations are moving in a similar direction. This approach
          helps highlight the importance of the issue, but it also means the
          article misses some depth. For example, it doesn't explore how
          widespread internet access really is, or how affordability and
          infrastructure affect people in different parts of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the strongest parts of the article is how it shows that the
          pandemic exposed deep inequalities. Kasapis says that being offline
          during the lockdown wasn't just frustrating, it was dangerous and
          unfair. This idea connects well with other writers like Nanjira
          Sambuli and Christoph Lutz, who point out that digital exclusion isn't
          just about having internet access, but also about being able to use it
          properly. People need good devices, enough data, digital skills, and
          the freedom to go online safely. While Kasapis hints at this, he
          doesn't fully explore how these issues play out across different
          groups, like low-income families, disabled people, or those living in
          rural areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another area that feels a bit underdeveloped is the question of what
          should actually be done. Kasapis raises important points, should
          internet access be free? Who's responsible for making it happen?, but
          doesn't suggest specific solutions. He doesn't talk about how
          governments could work with internet providers or how public spaces
          like libraries could help. In comparison, some countries like Chile
          and Colombia took real steps during the pandemic by treating internet
          as a public utility. Thinkers like Merten Reglitz have also argued
          that internet access is needed to enjoy other rights, like education
          or political participation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kasapis's article also doesn't touch much on digital literacy. Just
          because someone has internet doesn't mean they can use it well or
          safely. Access is only the first step. People also need to know how to
          use digital tools, protect their privacy, and engage meaningfully
          online. This has been discussed by scholars like Jan van Dijk, who
          outlines that digital inclusion includes motivation, access, skills,
          and outcomes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite these gaps, Kasapis's main point is powerful. He shows that
          being offline in today's world is more than inconvenient, it's unfair.
          The internet plays such a big role in our lives that denying people
          access widens existing inequalities. Recognizing internet access as a
          basic right could be a big step toward making society more equal.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end, Kasapis doesn't offer a full blueprint for how to achieve
          digital equity, but his message is clear and urgent. The pandemic
          showed us that digital access isn't a luxury anymore, it's a lifeline.
          His article pushes us to think about what kind of future we want, and
          how we can make sure that no one is left behind in a world that's
          increasingly online.
