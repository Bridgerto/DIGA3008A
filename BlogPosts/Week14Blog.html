        <p>
          When I think about how I want to approach justice and ethics in my
          artistic and programming work, I know it’s not just about what I
          create, but how and why I create it. I’ve come to realise that every
          decision I make, what tools I use, who I design for, what stories I
          tell, what I choose to leave out, carries values. Whether I’m making
          an interactive piece, designing a game, or coding a system, I want to
          be intentional about those choices.
        </p>

        <p>
          One reading that really stuck with me is Values at Play by Flanagan,
          Howe, and Nissenbaum (2005). They argue that games and interactive
          systems are never value-neutral. Instead of pretending that technology
          is “just a tool,” they encourage designers to think about the social
          and moral impact of their work. That made me think a lot about how I
          approach my own projects, especially since I’m someone who wants to
          mix art, culture, and tech in meaningful ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, it starts with awareness. I try to ask myself, What values are
          already showing up in my work, even unintentionally? Am I reinforcing
          harmful stereotypes? Am I making something only accessible to people
          with fast internet or expensive devices? If I’m designing something
          interactive, I want to think about who’s being represented and who’s
          being left out.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the things the authors suggest is thinking about
          “value-sensitive design,” which means including values like
          inclusivity, fairness, and empathy right from the start, not as an
          afterthought. I like the idea that you can design systems that reflect
          care, dignity, and community, just as much as you can design ones that
          are efficient or flashy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my art practice, I’m drawn to exploring themes like identity,
          inequality, and the lived experiences of people in underrepresented
          communities. That means I need to be thoughtful about how I frame
          those stories. Am I telling someone else’s story without their voice?
          Am I making assumptions based on my own worldview? These are tough
          questions, but they’re necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the programming side, justice also means thinking about data, where
          it comes from, who collected it, and what’s being done with it. I
          don’t want to build systems that rely on biased algorithms or exploit
          people’s information just to make something “work.” I think it’s okay
          to slow down and question the purpose of what I’m building. Who
          benefits? Who might be harmed?
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, I want to make work that reflects care and responsibility. I
          don’t always have the answers, but I think the first step is staying
          open and honest about the impact of my choices. Justice and ethics
          aren’t a box to tick off, they’re part of the entire process. I want
          my creative work to ask questions, hold space for different voices,
          and help build something better, even in small ways.
