        <h2>
          Section 1: ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of
          Media (1991)’ by Stuart Moulthrop
        </h2>
        <p>
          This week’s reading by Stuart Moulthrop, You Say You Want a
          Revolution: Hypertext and the Laws of Media, really made me pause and
          think about the tech we use every day without questioning it.
          Moulthrop dives into the world of hypertext, you know, all those
          clickable links that send you bouncing from one page to the next, and
          asks: is this stuff truly revolutionary, or are we just dressing up
          old tools in a digital costume?
        </p>

        <p>
          To help unpack that, Moulthrop uses Marshall McLuhan’s “Laws of
          Media,” a kind of four-part checklist to analyze what any new medium
          does to our world. The checklist goes like this: What does the medium
          enhance? What does it make old or useless? What does it bring back
          from the past? And finally, what happens when it’s pushed to the
          extreme? It’s kind of like looking at your favorite new gadget and
          figuring out its superpower, its weakness, its retro vibes, and what
          happens when it glitches. Moulthrop applies this to hypertext and
          makes one thing clear right off the bat: hypertext isn’t here to
          replace books. And honestly, that makes sense. Books are like a long
          walk on a quiet path, you go in one direction, slowly, thoughtfully.
          Hypertext, on the other hand, is more like zipping through a maze with
          twenty open tabs and YouTube playing in the background. It’s fast and
          flexible, sure, but it can also be pretty distracting.
        </p>

        <p>
          While hypertext gives readers the power to jump between topics and
          explore freely, that same freedom can mess with our ability to sit
          with complex ideas. You don’t get the same kind of deep thinking when
          you’re constantly hopping from one link to another. Moulthrop warns
          that what once felt like a digital revolution might now just be a
          noisy echo of old media forms, just messier and more overwhelming. So
          is hypertext revolutionary or just... chaotic? Moulthrop doesn’t say
          it’s all bad. He just wants us to ask better questions about the tools
          we use. Because even though hypertext changed how we read, write, and
          think, it hasn’t made the book, or deep thought, obsolete. And maybe
          it never will.

        <h2>Section 2: Folder Structure and URL Scheme</h2>
        <p>
          I created a main folder, DIGA3008. Within this main folder I am going
          to open 5 sub-folders: Homepage, Blog Posts, Design Section, Essay
          section and Profile and Portfolio pages. For each subfolder, I want
          sub-subfolders to carry images, videos, animations, styles(carries the
          CSS), design(captures the HTML) and scripts(stores the Javascripts).
          These sub-subfolders will be of service to each respective sub-folder.
        </p>

        <h2>Section 3: Wireframe Ideas</h2>
        <p>
          Put in images of your first wireframe ideas and explain what you are
          thinking of doing.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            class="u-photo"

            homepage.

        <h2>Section 4: Inspo Websites</h2>
        <p>
          Put links to inspirational websites, and start collecting reference
          material here.

          https://loish.net/art-of-loish/Links to an external site. - navigation
          system. On the right side of the screen and not on the top. A move
          away from the conventional navigation bar being at the top.

          <a class="u-url" href="https://www.beeple-crap.com">Beeple-crap</a>
          - navigation system intertwined with the interface design. Playing a
          video on my home page, but also adding the sound and pausing option.
          This is is make it a comfortable experience and not overstimulate
          them. They will have the option to listen and play the homepage intro
          video.

          to an external site. - good navigation system, love the arrows as
          indicators of more options, also like the alignment in text. There is
          a clear distinction between heading, subheadings, and the paragraphs
          in an article. The articles are also aligned in such a way that you
          can see which is the article and the sub article that you can click to
          read. (scaling)

          site. - when I hover over images they turn from sharp to curved edges.
          I also love the option of hovering over the button and the background
          changes to indicate that the option is clickable. Font is too big and
          makes the experience jarring for the viewer so this website also has
          brought to my attention the importance of font size and general
          website scaling.
