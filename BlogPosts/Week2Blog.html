          <b>Question: Reflect on this week's reading by Moulthrop.</b> <br />

          In You Say You Want a Revolution: Hypertext and the Laws of Media,
          Moulthrop speaks about the origin and evolution of hypertext. He
          offers an analysis on the role of hypertext in the digital culture by
          placing it against Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media which consists of
          his “four-part media interrogation” (Moulthrop 2003: P691). Here,
          Moulthroup looks at hypertext from the lens of McLuhan's question, all
          to assess whether hypertext is a revolutionary or problematic medium.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, in the first paragraph he points out that “hypertext does not
          replace the book” - this speaks back to the role that each of these
          mediums play for cognitive and cultural abilities. Books are already
          pre-written meaning that an individual and deep and meaningful
          knowledge accumulate and sustain longer critical thoughts. Whereas
          hypertext is a form of linking branches of information, moving from
          one source of information to another breaks engagement and allows
          distractions to happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Folder structure</b>
          <br />

          I created a main folder, DIGA3008. Within this main folder I am going
          to open 5 sub-folders: Homepage, Blog Posts, Design Section, Essay
          section and Profile and Portfolio pages. For each subfolder, I want
          sub-subfolders to carry images, videos, animations, styles(carries the
          CSS), design(captures the HTML) and scripts(stores the Javascripts).
          These sub-subfolders will be of service to each respective sub-folder.

          - navigation system intertwined with the interface design. Playing a
          video on my home page, but also adding the sound and pausing option.
          This is is make it a comfortable experience and not overstimulate

          to an external site. - good navigation system, love the arrows as
          indicators of more options, also like the alignment in text. There is
          a clear distinction between heading, subheadings, and the paragraphs
          in an article. The articles are also aligned in such a way that you
          can see which is the article and the sub article that you can click to
          read. (scaling)

          site. - when I hover over images they turn from sharp to curved edges.
          I also love the option of hovering over the button and the background
          changes to indicate that the option is clickable. Font is too big and
          makes the experience jarring for the viewer so this website also has
          brought to my attention the importance of font size and general
          website scaling.
