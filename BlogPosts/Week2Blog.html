      <p>Question: Reflect on this week's reading by Moulthrop.</p>

      <p>
        In You Say You Want a Revolution: Hypertext and the Laws of Media,
        Moulthrop speaks about the origin and evolution of hypertext. He offers
        an analysis on the role of hypertext in the digital culture by placing
        it against Marshall McLuhan’s Laws of Media which consists of his
        “four-part media interrogation” (Moulthrop 2003: P691). Here, Moulthroup
        looks at hypertext from the lens of McLuhan's question, all to assess
        whether hypertext is a revolutionary or problematic medium.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, in the first paragraph he points out that “hypertext does not
        replace the book” - this speaks back to the role that each of these
        mediums play for cognitive and cultural abilities. Books are already
        pre-written meaning that an individual and deep and meaningful knowledge
        accumulate and sustain longer critical thoughts. Whereas hypertext is a
        form of linking branches of information, moving from one source of
        information to another breaks engagement and allows distractions to
        happen.

      <p>Folder structure</p>
      <p>
        I created a main folder, DIGA3008. Within this main folder I am going to
        open 5 sub-folders: Homepage, Blog Posts, Design Section, Essay section
        and Profile and Portfolio pages. For each subfolder, I want
        sub-subfolders to carry images, videos, animations, styles(carries the
        CSS), design(captures the HTML) and scripts(stores the Javascripts).
        These sub-subfolders will be of service to each respective sub-folder.

        system. On the right side of the screen and not on the top. A move away
        from the conventional navigation bar being at the top.

        option to listen and play the homepage intro video.

        navigation system and how the main logo takes you back to the home page
        https://www.gucci.com/za/en_gb/Links to an external site. - dynamic
        navigation system, how it grows then shrinks, also has an elegant,
        sophisticated feel. https://www.itsnicethat.com/Links to an external
        site. - love the search bar for article, could come in handy in the blog
        section https://www.cartoonbrew.com/Links to an external site. - good
        navigation system, love the arrows as indicators of more options, also
        like the alignment in text. There is a clear distinction between
        heading, subheadings, and the paragraphs in an article. The articles are
        also aligned in such a way that you can see which is the article and the
        sub article that you can click to read. (scaling)
        https://www.danmachado.com/Links to an external site. - when I hover
        over images they turn from sharp to curved edges. I also love the option
        of hovering over the button and the background changes to indicate that
        the option is clickable. Font is too big and makes the experience
        jarring for the viewer so this website also has brought to my attention
        the importance of font size and general website scaling.
