    WEEK 1: BLOG POST

18 FEBRUARY 2025

 
SECTION 1: SETTING UP 

My Experience with setting up GitHub was paradoxically both simple and complicated. 
When the steps of setting it up in class were explained, it seemed straightforward. 
But sitting alone and attempting to do it was not a linear process. The first hurdle was 
realising that I misunderstood Visual Studios as Visual Studio Code. 
So you could imagine the frustration of staring at slides with VSCode having a 
blue interface while I had Visual Studios open and I kept seeing a purple interface. 
Eventually, I figured it out and downloaded VSCode. 

From there, the next hiccup was misunderstanding one of the slides. 
After opening a new file in VSCode, and typing “index.html”. I was meant to type the 
exclamation mark (!), then click the tab button on the keyboard. But the slide did not
 explain it this way, it had written type !(tab). I was stuck on the step for a good 
 day, but I reached out to my peers and got it sorted. From this point onwards, 
 everything was smooth sailing. Overall, I would rate the experience a 7/10.

 

SECTION 2: READING 1 

I chose an article by Tim Bernes-Lee published in 1994, titled The World Wide Web. 
This phenomenal written piece introduces the origin of the WWW or as the article 
says, W3, to have been created at CERN to solve the problem of information circulation 
amongst researchers. Here Bernes-Lee goes into details about the structures that were 
used to create W3: from HTML, HTTP, TCP, IP, URIs to SGML parsers. 


I think for me, what became overwhelming was the depth of the technical details 
introduced in the paper, along with a library of foundational concepts. Reading 
about these terms and details was not the main problem, the challenge was making 
the mental connection of how each term works with one another. Like you know in Maths, 
you are first taught that 2 + 2 = 4 this foundation of addition later helps one 
understand why 4/2 = 2. 

I wish there was a similar system offered when learning of web terminology, 
a structure that helps one see the connection of the terms about Internet protocols, 
to URIs vs URLs. Or even the GET, PUT or POST methods mentioned in the paper. 


SECTION 3: READING 2  

FLASH

I read an article, Flash And Its History On The Web, which unpacks the history behind 
FuturespLASH (FLASH) along with its evolution. Initially, FLASH was a FutureSplash 
Animator that was developed by FutureWave Software in the mid-1990s to be used as an 
animation tool for pen computing devices. In late 1996, Macromedia bought FutureSplash 
and rebranded it as FLASH. Software s prevalence picked up when it introduced the 
feature to stream compressed video content directly within web browsers. This feature 
would become the foundational blocks of how YouTube came to be.  

 

TIMELINES

Next I read a website that breaks down that timeline of the history of the web between 
2002 and 2017. This timeline was interesting because it revealed how tech companies 
shape the industry not just through innovation but through carefully timed decisions 
that reshape the competitive landscape. iPhone strategically designed mobile devices 
that were released to not need the FLASH function. This  forced web developers to 
transition to HTML5, which was more open and efficient but also happened to weaken 
Adobe s grip on web content.




SECTION 4: COURSE GOALS

My goal in this course is to learn with intention. I really want to begin exploring 
the fun of web creation.
