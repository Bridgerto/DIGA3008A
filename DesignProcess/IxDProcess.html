      <h2>GOAL ALIGNMENT</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of my website is to curate a chic, elegant, and sophisticated
        platform that includes some fashion elements - this choice is largely
        influenced by my interest in haute couture fashion culture and I want it
        to reflect my Interaction Design (IxD) process. The intention is to have
        a platform thatâ€™s polished and appears cohesive, offering users a sense
        of first-class treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I plan to achieve this through making an accessible, refined, and
        visually engaging website that embodies the essence of a fashion
        catalogue. This is because in the broader spectrum, my target audience
        is animation and interactive media companies that are potentially
        offering employment opportunities. Additionally, I also want it to be a
        space for artists seeking inspiration through exploring my animation
        portfolio and my other artworks (some of which will have a blend of
        fashion within them).
      </p>
      <p>
        At the core of my IxD process is ensuring a seamless and intuitive user
        experience where everything feels effortlessly available. This will go
        hand-in-hand with a well-structured UI with carefully curated colour
        palettes, high quality visuals and intentional font styles to make
        navigating the space feel intuitive to users. My website will have
        consistency and a strong information hierarchy so that key information
        is easy to find, encouraging users to interact with the site in a way
        that feels both inviting and effortless.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crucial aspect of first-class treatment is making sure users never
        have to struggle to find what they need, navigation should feel smooth
        and instinctive. I also want my website to be versatile, it will be
        accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
      </p>
