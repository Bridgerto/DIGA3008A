        <h2>Your Goal And Aesthetic As A Single Statement:</h2>
        <p>
          A website offering a chic, elegant, and sophisticated experience that
          reflects my Interaction Design (IxD) process by combining a polished
          aesthetic inspired by haute couture fashion culture with seamless,
          intuitive navigation that offers first-class treatment to companies in
          the Animation and Interactive Media industry, as well as artists
          seeking inspiration. It prioritises accessibility, versatility, and
          thoughtful design. Serves as an immersive journey where high-quality
          visuals, a strong information hierarchy, are usable across all
          devices.
        </p>

        <h2>The Visual Design Elements Eelected:</h2>
        <p>
          Navigation bar (with icons), Footer(with icons), Buttons, Search bar,
          Images, Animations, a Video, Angular and curved shapes, panels, Colour
          palette (Neutral shades and dark hues), and lastly will have adequate
          negative space to give it the clean look.
        </p>

        <h2>Colour Theory And Relationships:</h2>
        <p>
          As I said, I want a website that mimics the elegance and
          sophistication of haute-couture. My colour theory will be focused on a
          chic colour palette similar to a fashion catalogue. I have neutral
          colours that provide a clean and high-fashion look while the dark hues
          add contrast, depth and a sense of sophistication to make the visuals
          in my website stand out. My website will have a balance of curved and
          angular shapes; this duality ensures that elegance forms curved shapes
          along with modernity and structure for the angular elements.
        </p>

        <h2>Colour Palette:</h2>

        <p>
          The #F4F4F4 (Soft White) colour would be good for providing a
          background for clean, spacious layouts. <br />
          The #B4AEA2 (Muted Taupe) colour would be for UI elements, as in
          functioning as an accent color for buttons, headings, or subtle
          textures. <br />
          The #4B4F46 (Olive Grey) colour would work for secondary elements like
          menus or overlays to add richness. <br />
          The #14181A (Deep Black) is allocated to the text aspects in website,
          it has a strong visual contrast, and luxury appeal.
        </p>

        <div>
          <img
            src="./Images/ColourPaletteImg1.jpg"
            width="600px"
            alt="Image of Color palettes with their respective colour codes."
          />
          <img
            src="./Images/ColourPaletteImg2.jpg"
            width="600px"
            alt="Image of Color palettes with their respective colour codes."
          />
        </div>

        <h2>Fonts</h2>
        <p>
          To maintain readability and legibility, I chose fonts that still
          encapsulate a modern and minimalistic elegance.
        </p>

        <div>
          <figure>
            <figcaption>Heading Font</figcaption>
            <img src="Images/HeadingFont.png" alt="Image of Didot Font" />
          </figure>
          <figure>
            <figcaption>Body Text Font</figcaption>
            <img src="Images/BodyTextFont.png" alt="Image of Avenir Font" />
          </figure>
        </div>

        <h2>composition</h2>
        <p>
          My webpages will follow a harmonious and balanced structure that
          prioritizes clarity and visual order. To establish a clear hierarchy,
          each section begins with a heading followed by the corresponding body
          text. This approach ensures that users can easily navigate and
          understand the content. Every page will consistently feature a
          navigation bar at the top and a footer at the bottom to maintain
          structural continuity. Additionally, a prominent header will indicate
          which specific webpage is being viewed, helping users stay oriented
          throughout their experience. The overall design emphasizes coherence,
          usability, and aesthetic balance across all parts of the site.
        </p>

        <h2>Sketch Of Possible Designs With Interface Elements</h2>
        <p>
          An image I sketched through Krita to map out how my main homepage with
          look like, with possible logo design along with icons in the footer.
