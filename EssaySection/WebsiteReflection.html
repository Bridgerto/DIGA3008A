      <article class="e-content">
        <p>
          Creating my first personal website was a challenging but rewarding
          experience that taught me a lot about web development, time
          management, and letting go of perfectionism. Throughout this process,
          I did my best to meet the requirements of each language (HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript) and I believe I managed to achieve the basic
          expectations in each area.
        </p>

        <p>
          When it comes to folder structure, I made sure to separate my concerns
          clearly. My HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are stored in separate
          folders, which I believe helped maintain clarity and scalability in my
          project. I followed naming conventions that made it easy for me to
          locate and update files when needed, and my structure loosely reflects
          the hierarchy of my website's content.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of semantic markup, I used appropriate HTML tags to give
          structure and meaning to my content. I aimed to express my interface
          and content elements correctly so that both the browser and the user
          could understand the purpose of each section. While I still need to
          deepen my understanding of how semantic HTML can improve
          accessibility, I’m aware of its importance and will definitely
          continue to grow in this area.
        </p>
        <p>
          A weakness I picked up toward the end of my project was in font sizing
          and visual hierarchy. During a consultation, it was brought to my
          attention that the contrast between my headings and body text was too
          different. My headings appeared very large compared to the small
          paragraph text, which created an uncomfortable reading experience.
          This was something I had overlooked until the later stages of
          development, and it’s a lesson I’ll carry forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          My CSS styling was something I paid a lot of attention to, and I
          generally enjoyed the process of designing the look and feel of my
          website. That said, I struggled with maintaining consistency,
          especially with my initially proposed colour palette and layout
          spacing. At times, my design would look cohesive, and then suddenly it
          would feel jarring or disconnected. I’ve realized this was due to
          working without a solid plan or design system in place. In future
          projects, I want to set clearer guidelines for myself upfront to help
          maintain consistency throughout.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to JavaScript, I used it in a very minimal way. I
          focused mainly on basic DOM manipulation and event handling, but I now
          see that there’s a lot more I could’ve explored. I was unsure of how
          to expand the interactivity further, which reflects my current gap in
          knowledge. I definitely want to grow my skillset in JavaScript so I
          can make future websites more dynamic and engaging.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest reflections I have is about time management. I
          didn’t pace myself well throughout the project, and often found myself
          jumping between sections, one moment I’d be working on blogs, the next
          on the essay page, then on the portfolio. This scattered approach
          eventually left me feeling overwhelmed, which stalled my motivation
          and progress. I’ve come to see how important it is to work within a
          structured system, dividing tasks into manageable chunks and sticking
          to a routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another key lesson was learning to let go of attachment to my initial
          design. I started the semester with wireframes that I felt very
          committed to. But as deadlines approached and new requirements came
          in, I had to adapt and I often found myself resisting that change for
          too long. In hindsight, I wish I had let go of certain design ideas
          earlier to make space for more realistic solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, while I enjoyed the technical learning, I didn’t manage to
          make my site as accessible or responsive as I had hoped. I didn’t
          implement media queries to make it mobile-friendly, and this was less
          about lack of knowledge and more about running out of time. I
          understand the importance of accessibility and responsive design, and
          it’s definitely something I’ll prioritise in future projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I found this project incredibly valuable. It introduced me to
          the fundamentals of coding and gave me insight into what it means to
          bring ideas to life through web development. While there were hurdles,
          I never felt like I couldn’t get through them, I just had to keep
          learning, experimenting, and staying patient with myself.
