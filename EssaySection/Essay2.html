      <article class="e-content">
        <p>
          In early February 2025, Google Maps took a controversial step and
          officialised the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of
          America. This change only affects people using the app in the United
          States of America, those in Mexico will not see the change while
          everyone else around the world will see: Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of
          America). Google took this action in accordance with an executive
          order signed by President Donald Trump, which called for the restoring
          of names that “honor American greatness”. As part of the same
          initiative, Trump took a step further and declared February 9th as
          “Gulf of America Day” (Davies, 2025), encouraging the public to
          commemorate the change nationwide. In response, the Mexican government
          disapproved of this action, arguing the US had no legal right to
          independently follow through with the renaming. The Mexican president,
          Claudia Sheinbaum, even wrote a formal letter to ask Google to
          reconsider the name change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The company responded by explaining that the move is part of a
          “longstanding practice” of following name changes when updated by
          official government sources. As of today, the change remains in place.
          This incident highlights how digital platforms like Google Maps are
          not neutral tools, they can be used to reflect and enforce
          geopolitical agendas. What appears to be a name change reveals layered
          issues around power, representation and territorial narratives in the
          digital age. The map becomes a symbolic battleground where
          geopolitical power plays out. This conflict around the renaming
          reflects ways in which digital colonialism continues to play out
          today. Powerful nations along with their companies continue to assert
          influence and reshape narratives by claiming space even on digital
          platforms. Thus revealing the complex relationship between the
          internet, geopolitics and digital colonialism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Map renaming the Gulf of Mexico may seem like a neutral
          interface change, meanwhile this shows how digital platforms can
          become extensions of power from the government that reinforce
          nationalistic agendas. In this event, the executive order signed by
          Trump in order to "honor American Greatness" frames the renaming as a
          patriotic act, he even “said … that the name Gulf of America had a
          “beautiful ring. It's appropriate. And Mexico has to stop allowing
          millions of people to pour into our country” (Milmo 2025). This
          statement shows that the name change has a political agenda. Not to
          mention that Trump was not in office when the name appeared on Google
          Maps, the change was still accepted because it was added to an
          official U.S. database called the Geographic Names Information System
          (GNIS). Google explained that the renaming is following official
          government data. Which highlights a deeper issue surrounding legal
          systems and digital platforms always helping to spread only one
          country's view over others. This shows that the power to define
          digital space is unevenly distributed, often favoring dominant
          countries like the United States. As Mark Graham (2014) argues in
          Internet Geographies, the internet is not a flat or neutral space, it
          is structured by global inequalities in data production,
          representation, and visibility. Platforms like Google Maps source most
          of their naming data from institutions in the Global North, meaning
          their digital geographies often reflect Western political realities
          and priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the Mexican government disagreed with the name change to
          a body of water that is shared internationally. President Sheinbaum
          highlighted the “...[Law of the Seas by] United Nations Convention
          [which] dictates that an individual country's sovereign territory only
          extends up to 12 nautical miles out from the coastline” (Davies 2025)
          meaning that the US could not legally change the Gulf's name. Yet the
          name change still appeared for users in the US and partially from
          everyone around the world, showing how platforms can be used as
          geopolitical instruments through shaping people's perception of the
          internet and the real world. Graham supports this notion by affirming
          that those with the infrastructure and resources to generate and
          formalise data are more likely to have their narratives digitally
          amplified. This therefore emphasises that digital spaces are not
          neutral, when paired with legal systems alongside influential tech
          companies, they can reshape digital representation of geography under
          the guise of government policies to favour and extend geopolitical
          power. Thus reflecting digital colonialism happening in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way digital colonialism shows up is when digital platforms
          choose to continue systems of power by giving more weight to dominant
          countries' views while ignoring others. In this case, Google renaming
          the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America is more than just a name
          change, it is a symbolic act of rewriting history. A powerful country,
          the US, using digital tools to rename a place with deep cultural and
          historical significance to another, becomes a form of epistemic
          erasure. This kind of renaming strips Mexico and its people of the
          right to define their own spaces and histories. As Birhane (2020)
          argues in Algorithmic Colonization of Africa, such practices reflect a
          larger pattern of epistemic control, where dominant states (from the
          Global North) determine what knowledge is seen as legitimate, worth
          preserving and relevant. Thus resulting in the reduction and ignoring
          or overwriting of local, contextual and indigenous ways of knowing.
          Which reflects what Birhane calls the "outsourcing of cognitive
          authority", where powerful institutions export their own frameworks of
          understanding while "dismissing the epistemologies of those being
          represented" (Birhane 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore showing how the current structure and operation of the
          digital ecosystem tends to prioritise or give more visibility to the
          narratives and interests of powerful countries, usually from the
          Global North. Which further suggests that digital spaces are not
          equal, this appearance of neutrality isn't accidental, it was encoded
          this way in order to frame technology as something that functions as a
          trusted global tool. While in actuality, it is an active participant
          in shaping reality, through embedding the values and worldviews of
          those who build and control them. This turns the global infrastructure
          into a stage for digital colonisation, just like colonial maps once
          defined territories according to imperial logics, today's digital maps
          do the same through determining who gets to name, define, and narrate
          the world. Birhane's work reminds us that these are not just
          technological issues, but deeply political and ethical ones about
          voice, dignity, and the right to self-representation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moreover, this renaming incident brings to attention how digital
          colonialism operates as part of a larger system of Neocolonialism.
          Now, powerful countries are using indirect means like technology,
          media and data to gain control over less powerful countries. In the
          earlier paragraph, I quoted Trump's comment, “Mexico has to stop
          allowing millions of people to pour into our country” (Milmo 2025),
          showing that the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico is not just a digital
          decision, it reflects a deeper political strategy. The name change is
          tied to a broader anti-immigrant and nationalistic agenda. Thus
          highlighting how digital spaces can reinforce systemic racism and
          discrimination under the guise of patriotism. To affirm this argument,
          Lutz's 2019 article on digital inequalities touches on the ways
          inequality goes beyond access, it's about how digital systems are used
          and what outcomes they produce. In this case, the renaming reflects
          control over digital representation, where the US narrative is
          algorithmically embedded into global platforms. The US deciding to
          rename a shared body of water without consulting Mexico is a symbolic
          act of cultural dominance. Which again emphasizes the orchestrated
          neutrality of digital platforms, they operate in the broader
          conversation of Neocolonialism.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, this case study reveals how digital platforms (Google Maps in
          this case) are not passive tools but active participants in global
          power dynamics. The act of promoting the single ideologies of dominant
          countries shows their contribution to digital colonialism and reflects
          broader patterns of colonialism. The appearance of a simple
          technological decision actually carries deeper implications around
          political influence, cultural erasure and systemic inequality.
